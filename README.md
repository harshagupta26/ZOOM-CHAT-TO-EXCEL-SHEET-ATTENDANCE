# ZOOM-CHAT-TO-EXCEL-SHEET-ATTENDANCE
Converting attendance given in zoom chat to excel sheet using python in built libraries.
Students were asked to login online classes in a particular format like- rollno._name ,
I tried making a program to facilitate for the faculty to keep the record of chat as 
students were asked to give attendance through chatbox.
